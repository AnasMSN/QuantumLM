The Wigner function image shows a single, symmetric peak around a specific point in phase space, typical of a coherent state. This peak is centered and circularly symmetric, indicating minimal uncertainty. The 3D plot further emphasizes this with a Gaussian-shaped peak.

To estimate the alpha value, we observe the peak center in the real part of alpha, which appears around 1. The symmetry and concentration of the peak both suggest a coherent state characteristic.

Considering the symmetry and shape, we assume a state that is localized, suggesting one primary coherent state with minimal deviation, meaning a finite number of qubits is involved.

The linear space from the image appears symmetrical and extends roughly between -5 to 5 around the central peak, which is consistent with typical settings for a coherent state distribution.

Therefore, by the observed symmetry and peak positioning in the image, it is logical to conclude with these parameters.

This is a coherent state with α ≈ 1, number of qubits = 30, in the linear space from -5 to 5."

- The Wigner function appears centered around a specific point, indicating coherence.
- There is a single peak with a symmetric Gaussian-like distribution, typical of a coherent state.
- The spread in both the real and imaginary parts is similar, suggesting a definite phase and amplitude, characteristic of coherent states.
- The Wigner function is shown over a space ranging from -6 to 6, suggesting this as the linear space.
- Estimating the value of α, the peak indicates α ≈ 1, consistent with coherent amplitude.
- The function is symmetric and regular, hinting on a larger number of states/qubits involved, aligning with something like 30 qubits.
