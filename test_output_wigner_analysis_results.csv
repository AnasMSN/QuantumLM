The Wigner function image shows a single, symmetric peak around a specific point in phase space, typical of a coherent state. This peak is centered and circularly symmetric, indicating minimal uncertainty. The 3D plot further emphasizes this with a Gaussian-shaped peak.

To estimate the alpha value, we observe the peak center in the real part of alpha, which appears around 1. The symmetry and concentration of the peak both suggest a coherent state characteristic.

Considering the symmetry and shape, we assume a state that is localized, suggesting one primary coherent state with minimal deviation, meaning a finite number of qubits is involved.

The linear space from the image appears symmetrical and extends roughly between -5 to 5 around the central peak, which is consistent with typical settings for a coherent state distribution.

Therefore, by the observed symmetry and peak positioning in the image, it is logical to conclude with these parameters.

1. Observe the Wigner function plot shape: The 2D image shows a circular, symmetric distribution, indicating a thermal state. This shape suggests a lack of coherent structure, typical of thermal states.

2. Note the spread: The Wigner function is spread across a range with a peak at the origin, reinforcing the idea of a thermal state, characterized by randomness and Gaussian spread around zero.

3. Determine the average photon number: A thermal state’s spread in phase space often corresponds to a certain average photon number. The visible spread in the plot hints at an average photon number around 3.

4. Determine the number of qubits and linear space: Based on the Wigner function spread, we estimate the linear space to be between -5 and 5. Given this range, the number of qubits for representing this state can be inferred as 30, which aligns with the typical dimension needed for such a spread.

1. **Identify the Wigner Function Characteristics:**
   - The image shows a Wigner function that is circular and positive everywhere. This suggests a thermal state.

2. **Determine the Average Photon Number:**
   - A thermal state typically has a Gaussian shape centered at the origin, with the spread indicating the average number of photons. The spread here resembles that of a thermal state with ≈ 3 average photons.

3. **Estimate the Number of Qubits:**
   - The linear space extends from -6 to 6 in both real and imaginary axes. This range suggests a discretization appropriate for about 30 qubits.

4. **Check Consistency with Typical Quantum Systems:**
   - A thermal state with an average photon number of 3 is consistent with a Hilbert space dimension managed by 30 qubits, especially given the linear space range.

The Wigner function exhibits circular symmetry with alternating patterns, characteristic of a Fock state. The number of rings around the center usually indicates the photon number. Observing three prominent bright-dark rings implies the state is likely a Fock state with approximately three photons.

The 2D plot's scale extends from -6 to 6, suggesting the state spans a symmetric range in phase space. The linear space typically reflects the grid used for qubit simulation, usually needing more qubits for higher photon numbers and broader space. 

The structure and symmetry in the Wigner function indicate quantized patterns, implying a specific photon number and qubits structured to represent the state in phase space. Observing the scale and typical representation frameworks, such as this Wigner function range, suggests the configuration of the simulator.

1. **State Type Identification:**
   - The Wigner function displays concentric rings with alternating positive and negative values. This pattern is characteristic of a Fock state (or number state).

2. **Number of Photons:**
   - The number of rings in the Wigner function corresponds to the photon number plus one (n+1). The presence of 4 rings suggests a Fock state with 3 photons because 3+1=4.

3. **Determining the Number of Qubits:**
   - The blurred edges and spatial extent of the Wigner function usually indicate the number of qubits. This image seems like a 30-qubit system due to the radial extent.

4. **Linear Space:**
   - The Wigner function has a frame from -6 to 6 in both the real and imaginary parts, indicating the linear space extends from -6 to 6.

The Wigner function represents a quantum state in phase space. In the provided images:

1. **State Type**: The randomness and scattered peaks in the Wigner 3D plot, combined with the interference pattern seen in the Wigner 2D plot, suggest a random quantum state.

2. **Density Value**: The amplitude of the Wigner function, as seen in the color intensity and 3D height, typically results from quantum state overlap. Estimating from the image features, we approximate the density value around 0.1.

3. **Number of Qubits**: The complexity and spread of the pattern suggest more qubits. Given the detailed structure, it's consistent with larger systems (e.g., 30 qubits).

4. **Linear Space**: The plots display the range of variable axes extending linearly from approximately -5 to 5.

These characteristics align with an educated analysis of the Wigner function's visual cues.

This is a random state with number density value ≈ 0.1, number of qubits = 30, in the linear space from -5 to 5."

The Wigner function shown is complex, with both positive and negative regions, indicating a mixed or potentially highly entangled quantum state. The presence of these features suggests it is not a simple coherent or squeezed state.

The density of points or the amplitude in the central region about zero indicates a relatively low density value since there's a spread over the entire visual space with varying amplitudes not forming a single large positive or negative peak.

Considering the linear space covered by the Wigner function from approximately -6 to 6 on both Re(α) and Im(α) axes implies a certain scalability of the quantum system.

The structure and extent suggest a highly complex state that might span a relatively high number of qubits. 

Taking these observations into account, the state could indeed relate to a random-like mixed state, as it's spread over a wide linear space with the density being lower in a potentially uniform spread indicative of random or mixed states.

Thus, the number of qubits inferred here, which suits such a scattered and rich feature Wigner function, might be in the range aligned with extensive quantum systems.
